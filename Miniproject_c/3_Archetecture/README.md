DESIGN
We have three main actors in our system:

Librarian: Mainly responsible for adding and modifying books, book items, and users. The Librarian can also issue, reserve, and return book items.
Member: All members can search the catalog, as well as check-out, reserve, renew, and return a book.
System: Mainly responsible for sending notifications for overdue books, canceled reservations, etc.
Here are the top use cases of the Library Management System:

Add/Remove/Edit book: To add, remove or modify a book or book item.
Search catalog: To search books by title, author, subject or publication date.
Register new account/cancel membership: To add a new member or cancel the membership of an existing member.
Check-out book: To borrow a book from the library.
Reserve book: To reserve a book which is not currently available.
Renew a book: To reborrow an already checked-out book.
Return a book: To return a book to the library which was issued to a member.
