IMPLEMENTATION
The design methodology used in the proposed system is parallel as a result of the fact that
parallel methods support the use of the proposed system side by side with the existing system
25
in order to test for the system efficiency.
Top down approach is used as well in the design because it allows the analysis of the system to be carried out one after the other.
In this stage, the first goal will be decided by task analysis.
Next, the prototype of the system will be analysed. 
Then test will be made on its usability and design with some design theories. 
Thus the prototype will be correspondingly looked at.
Then a more complete prototype will be tested by potential users to collect feedbacks.
Finally, the system will be finalized with the amendment on some problems of the user interface.
