TEST PLAN
i. Unit testing
In the V-Model, Unit Test Plans (UTPs) are developed during module design phase.
These UTPs are executed to eliminate bugs at code level or unit level. 
A unit is the smallest entity which can independently exist, e.g. a program module. Unit testing verifies that the smallest
entity can function correctly when isolated from the rest of the codes/units.

ii. Integration testing
Integration Test Plans are developed during the Architectural Design Phase.
These tests verify that units created and tested independently can coexist and communicate among
themselves. Test results are shared with customer's team.

iii. System testing
System Tests Plans are developed during System Design Phase.
Unlike Unit and Integration Test Plans, System Test Plans are composed by client's business team. System Test ensures
that expectations from application developed are met. 
The whole application is tested for its functionality, interdependency and communication.  
System Testing verifies that functional and non-functional requirements have been met.
Load and performance testing, stress testing, regression testing, etc. are subsets of system testing.

iv. User acceptance testing
User Acceptance Test (UAT) Plans are developed during the Requirements Analysis phase.
Test Plans are composed by business users.
User Acceptance Testing is performed in a user environment that resembles the production environment, using realistic data.
User Acceptance Testing verifies that delivered system meets user's requirement and system is
ready for use in real time.
